-----------------------------------
Step 1: Install Visual Studio Code (VS Code)

  1.  Open a web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, or Edge).
  2.  Go to the official VS Code website: https://code.visualstudio.com/
  3.  Click the "Download for Windows" button.
  4.  Once the download is complete, open the downloaded `.exe` file to run the installer.
  5.  Follow the on-screen instructions to install VS Code. Make sure to check the box that says "Add to PATH" during the installation process. This will allow you to open VS Code from the command line later.
  6.  Click "Finish" once the installation is complete. VS Code will likely open automatically.

Step 2: Install the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)

1. Open PowerShell as Administrator:
    * Click the Start button (Windows logo in the bottom-left corner).
    * Type "PowerShell".
    * Right-click on "Windows PowerShell" and select "Run as administrator". Click "Yes" if prompted.

2. Enable the WSL feature:
    * In the Administrator PowerShell window, type the following command and press Enter:
        ```
        wsl --install
        ```
    * This command will enable the necessary WSL features and install the default Ubuntu distribution.

3. Restart Your Computer
    * Once the installation is complete, you will be prompted to restart your computer. **Make sure to restart your computer.

Step 3: Complete the Ubuntu Installation

1.  After restarting, the Ubuntu terminal should automatically open. If it doesn't, you can open it by:
    * Clicking the Start button.
    * Typing "Ubuntu" and selecting the "Ubuntu" app.

2. Create a User Account and Password:
    * The first time you run Ubuntu, it will prompt you to create a new user account and password for your Ubuntu environment.
    * Choose a username and a strong, memorable password.
    * You will need to enter the password when prompted in the terminal (it won't show any characters as you type, this is normal).

Step 4: Update and Upgrade Ubuntu Packages

1.  Once you have created your user account and are in the Ubuntu terminal, it's important to update the package lists and upgrade the installed packages to their latest versions.

2. Run the following commands one by one, pressing Enter after each:
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt upgrade

    * You will be prompted for your Ubuntu user password.
    * Enter it and press Enter.
    * If prompted to confirm the upgrade (usually by asking "Do you want to continue? [Y/n]"), type `y` and press Enter.

Step 5: Install GCC (GNU Compiler Collection)

1.  To compile your C program, you need to install GCC.
    
    * In the Ubuntu terminal, run the following command and press Enter:
    sudo apt install build-essential

    * This command installs GCC, G++, make, and other essential tools for building software.
    * If prompted to confirm the installation, type `y` and press Enter.

Step 6: Install the Remote - SSH Extension in VS Code

1.  Open VS Code.
2.  Click on the Extensions icon in the Activity Bar on the left side (it looks like four squares forming one larger square).
3.  In the search bar, type "Remote - SSH".
4.  Find the extension published by Microsoft and click the "Install" button.
5.  Once installed, you might see a notification to reload VS Code. Click "Reload".

Step 7: Connect VS Code to Your WSL Ubuntu Environment

1.  Click on the "Remote Explorer" icon in the Activity Bar on the left side (it looks like a computer monitor with an arrow pointing into it).
  
  * If you don't see it, you can also access it by pressing `Ctrl+Shift+P` (or `Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS) and typing "Remote-SSH: Connect to Host...".

2.  In the dropdown menu that appears, select "WSL: Ubuntu".

3.  VS Code will open a new window, connecting to your WSL Ubuntu environment. You might see a prompt asking for your password again the first time you connect in a new window.
