ive attempted to do a docker container, but it needs alot more work, the interactive terminal is very shoddy and im still figuring out how to and what to publish publicly

--------------------------

take the dockerfile out of this folder when building and saving an image to it, then put it back in here

-----------------------------------

Create a new repo specifically for Labyrinth if we continue to use docker because the yaml file needs to be at the root
Copilot says this below:

"Yes, based on your git remote -v output, I can see that your workflow file is in the wrong repository structure. The workflow file is currently in: Projects/C/Labyrinth/2_Player_Random_Labyrinth/.github/workflows/

But it should be in a repository specifically for your Labyrinth project. GitHub Actions workflows need to be in the root of the repository they're meant to run in. Here's what you should do:

1. Create a new repository specifically for your Labyrinth project
2. Initialize it with a new git repository:

cd ~/Projects/C/Labyrinth/2_Player_Random_Labyrinth
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"

3. Create a new repository on GitHub named "2_Player_Random_Labyrinth" (or similar)
4. Link and push to the new repository:

git remote add origin https://github.com/JuanJoboy/2_Player_Random_Labyrinth.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main

This way, your .github/workflows folder will be at the root level of the repository that contains the actual project it's meant to build, and the Actions will trigger correctly.

Currently, GitHub is looking for workflows in your "Projects" repository root, not in the nested Labyrinth project folder, which is why the Actions aren't showing up."
